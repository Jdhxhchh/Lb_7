1. Understand Requirements:
   - Understand the entities involved: `Product`, `User`, `Order`, and the platform `ECommercePlatform`.
   - Recognize the relationships between entities, such as a `User` having a shopping `cart`, an `Order` containing `Product` details, etc.

2. Design Classes:
   - Design the classes for `Product`, `User`, and `Order` with appropriate attributes and methods.
   - Establish relationships between classes, such as `User` having a `cart` and `Order` having `orderDetails`.

3. Implement Comparable Interface (if needed):
   - Implement the `Comparable` interface for the `Product` class if comparison is necessary (as seen in the provided code).

4. Create a Platform Class:
   - Implement the `ECommercePlatform` class to manage users, products, and orders.
   - Include methods for adding users, adding products, creating orders, and updating product stock.

5. Write a Demo Program:
   - Write a demo program (`ECommerceDemo`) to demonstrate the functionality of the system.
   - Create instances of users, products, and orders.
   - Perform operations such as adding products to a user's cart, creating orders, updating product stock, and displaying information.

6. Use Java Collections and Stream API:
   - Utilize Java collections (e.g., `List`, `Map`) to store and manage data.
   - Leverage the Stream API for concise and expressive data processing operations.

7. Compile and Run:
   - Compile the Java source code using a Java compiler (`javac`).
   - Run the compiled program (`java` followed by the class name) to see the output.

8. Test and Debug:
   - Test the program with different scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Debug any issues that may arise during testing.

9. Refine and Enhance:
   - Refine the code, enhance features, or add additional functionality based on requirements.

10. Document the Code:
   - Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose of classes, methods, and any complex logic.
